## Testing Workflow

### 1. Launch App
Open Xcode and run the app on iOS Simulator or physical device.

### 2. Login
- Enter name: **Test Teacher**
- Tap "Start Session"
- Should receive auth token and proceed to debate setup

### 3. Create Debate
- Enter motion: "This house believes technology does more harm than good"
- Select format: WSDC
- Select level: Secondary
- Add students: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana
- Assign to teams (Prop: Alice, Bob / Opp: Charlie, Diana)
- Tap "Start Debate"
- Backend creates debate record via HTTPS

### 4. Record Speech
- Tap microphone to start recording
- Speak for 30-60 seconds
- Tap stop
- Upload progress shows (encrypted via HTTPS)
- Upload completes successfully

### 5. Processing
- App polls status every 5 seconds
- Status changes: pending â†’ processing â†’ complete
- Estimated time: 2-5 minutes
- Google Doc URL appears when complete

### 6. View Feedback
- Tap "View Feedback" when ready
- Opens Google Doc in Safari
- Review AI-generated feedback

---

## Security Features

### Transport Layer Security
- All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.2+
- SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Certificate auto-renewal enabled
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

### API Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication
- Token stored securely in UserDefaults
- Token included in Authorization header
- Token expiry handling

### Data Privacy
- Audio files stored locally
- Uploads encrypted in transit
- Backend deletes audio after transcription
- Feedback stored as Google Docs URLs

---

## Production Considerations

### Current Status
- HTTPS encryption enabled
- SSL certificate valid and auto-renewing
- Backend running headlessly
- Worker processing in background
- Production domain configured

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **SSL Pinning**: Pin certificate for additional security
2. **Keychain Storage**: Store auth token in iOS Keychain instead of UserDefaults
3. **Biometric Auth**: Add Face ID/Touch ID for app access
4. **Offline Mode**: Queue uploads when offline
5. **Analytics**: Add usage tracking
6. **Crash Reporting**: Integrate crash reporting service

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not connect to server"

**Possible Causes:**
- No internet connection
- Backend server down
- DNS resolution issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Test backend: `curl https://api.genalphai.com/api/health`
3. Check backend services: `systemctl status debate-feedback-backend`

---

### Issue: "Invalid credentials"

**Cause:** User doesn't exist in database

**Solution:** Create user in database:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (email, name, role, institution)
VALUES ('teacher@school.com', 'Teacher Name', 'teacher', 'School Name');
```

---

### Issue: "Upload failed"

**Possible Causes:**
- Network timeout
- File too large
- Backend storage full

**Solutions:**
1. Check network connection
2. Retry upload (app retries 3 times automatically)
3. Check backend logs: `journalctl -u debate-feedback-backend -f`

---

### Issue: "Processing never completes"

**Possible Causes:**
- Worker process not running
- Redis not running
- AssemblyAI API key invalid/quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker: `systemctl status debate-feedback-worker`
2. Check Redis: `redis-cli ping`
3. Check logs: `journalctl -u debate-feedback-worker -f`

Step 2: Add Microphone Permission (CRITICAL)
	•	Select DebateFeedback target
	•	Go to Info tab
	•	Click + button
	•	Add:
	•	Key: Privacy - Microphone Usage Description
	•	Value: We need access to the microphone to record debate speeches.

	•	See all speeches in grid
	•	Mock Google Docs links present
	•	Can tap to "view" (opens mock URL)


Known Limitations (Phase 7 - Not Critical)
	•	No auto-population from schedule API yet
	•	No history view yet
	•	iPad layouts not optimized yet
	•	Using system sounds for bells (custom MP3s not added)
	•	No unit/UI tests yet


Configuration Options
Backend Integration (When Ready)
Edit Utilities/Constants.swift:

enum API {

    static let baseURL = "https://your-backend.com/api"

    static let useMockData = false  // Change this

}
Debate Formats
All 5 formats are implemented:

	•	WSDC - 8 min speeches, 4 min reply (3v3)
	•	Modified WSDC - 4 min speeches, 2 min reply (3v3)
	•	BP - 7 min speeches (4x2)
	•	AP - 6 min speeches (2v2)
	•	Australs - 8 min speeches, 3 min reply (3v3)

Users can manually adjust times for custom formats.


Troubleshooting
"Microphone permission denied"
Solution: Add NSMicrophoneUsageDescription to Info.plist
"Recording failed"
Solution: Test on real device (simulator audio is unreliable)
Bells not audible
Normal: App uses system sounds. Add custom MP3s to Resources/Sounds/ folder:

	•	bell_1.mp3
	•	bell_2.mp3
	•	bell_3.mp3
Drag & drop not working
Solution: Works better on device than simulator

Setup Instructions
Critical: Microphone Permission Setup
Before running the app, you MUST add microphone permission to the project:
Method 1: Using Xcode UI (Recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Open DebateFeedback.xcodeproj in Xcode
	‚Ä¢	Select the DebateFeedback target in the project navigator
	‚Ä¢	Go to the Info tab
	‚Ä¢	Under "Custom iOS Target Properties", click the + button
	‚Ä¢	Add this entry:
	‚Ä¢	Key: Privacy - Microphone Usage Description (or NSMicrophoneUsageDescription)
	‚Ä¢	Type: String
	‚Ä¢	Value: We need access to the microphone to record debate speeches.
Method 2: Edit Info.plist Directly
If your project has an Info.plist file:

	‚Ä¢	Open DebateFeedback/Info.plist
	‚Ä¢	Add this XML:

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>

<string>We need access to the microphone to record debate speeches.</string>
Backend Configuration
1. Mock Mode (Development - No Backend Needed)
The app ships with mock mode enabled for testing:

// In Utilities/Constants.swift

enum API {

    static let useMockData = true  // Already set to true

}

With mock mode:

	‚Ä¢	All API calls return simulated data
	‚Ä¢	Uploads show progress but don't hit real servers
	‚Ä¢	Feedback polling returns mock Google Docs URLs
	‚Ä¢	Perfect for UI/UX testing
2. Production Mode (With Backend)
When your backend is ready:

// In Utilities/Constants.swift

enum API {

    static let baseURL = "https://your-backend.com/api"  // Update this

    static let useMockData = false  // Change to false

}
Optional: Bell Sound Files
The app works without these, but for authentic bell sounds:

	‚Ä¢	Create folder: DebateFeedback/Resources/Sounds
	‚Ä¢	Add these files:
	‚Ä¢	bell_1.mp3 - Single bell sound
	‚Ä¢	bell_2.mp3 - Double bell sound
	‚Ä¢	bell_3.mp3 - Triple bell sound
	‚Ä¢	Drag files into Xcode
	‚Ä¢	Ensure "Add to targets" checkbox is checked for DebateFeedback

Currently, the app uses system sounds as fallback.
Running the App
On Simulator
# Open in Xcode

open DebateFeedback.xcodeproj

# Or from command line

xcodebuild -project DebateFeedback.xcodeproj -scheme DebateFeedback -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'

Note: Audio recording may not work properly on simulator. Use a real device for full testing.
On Physical Device
	‚Ä¢	Connect your iPhone/iPad
	‚Ä¢	Select your device in Xcode's device menu
	‚Ä¢	Sign the app with your Apple ID:
	‚Ä¢	Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
	‚Ä¢	Check "Automatically manage signing"
	‚Ä¢	Select your Team (Personal Team is fine)
	‚Ä¢	Press ‚åòR to build and run
Testing Workflow
1. First Launch Test
	‚Ä¢	Launch app
	‚Ä¢	Should see microphone permission alert
	‚Ä¢	Tap "Allow"
	‚Ä¢	Should reach authentication screen
2. Guest Mode Test
	‚Ä¢	Tap "Continue as Guest"
	‚Ä¢	Enter motion: "This house believes that social media does more harm than good"
	‚Ä¢	Select format: WSDC
	‚Ä¢	Add students: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, Frank
	‚Ä¢	Drag students to teams (3 Prop, 3 Opp)
	‚Ä¢	Tap "Start Debate"
	‚Ä¢	Tap START - timer should run, REC indicator should show
	‚Ä¢	Speak for ~30 seconds
	‚Ä¢	Tap STOP - should auto-upload (progress bar) and move to next speaker
	‚Ä¢	Complete all 6 speeches
	‚Ä¢	Tap "View Feedback"
	‚Ä¢	Should see all speeches with mock Google Docs links
3. Teacher Mode Test
	‚Ä¢	Logout from guest mode
	‚Ä¢	Enter teacher name: "Mr. Smith"
	‚Ä¢	Tap "Login as Teacher"
	‚Ä¢	Follow same debate setup flow
	‚Ä¢	Note: Debates are saved to history (unlike guest mode)
Common Issues
‚ùå "Microphone permission denied"
Fix:

	‚Ä¢	Go to iPhone Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
	‚Ä¢	Enable DebateFeedback
	‚Ä¢	Restart app
‚ùå "Failed to start recording"
Causes:

	‚Ä¢	Permission not added to Info.plist ‚Üí Add it
	‚Ä¢	Another app using microphone ‚Üí Close other apps
	‚Ä¢	Running on simulator ‚Üí Use real device
‚ùå "Invalid recording file"
Fix: Ensure using real device, not simulator
‚ùå Upload shows "Failed"
Check:

	‚Ä¢	Is useMockData = true? Should succeed in mock mode
	‚Ä¢	Is backend URL correct?
	‚Ä¢	Is internet connected?
	‚Ä¢	Check backend logs
Project Status
‚úÖ Complete & Working
	‚Ä¢	Authentication (Teacher + Guest)
	‚Ä¢	Debate setup wizard (3 steps)
	‚Ä¢	Drag & drop team assignment
	‚Ä¢	Timer with 60fps precision
	‚Ä¢	Audio recording (M4A @ 128kbps)
	‚Ä¢	Background upload with retry

File Locations
After running the app, files are stored at:

/Users/[username]/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/[device-id]/data/Containers/Data/Application/[app-id]/Documents/Recordings/

Format: {debate_id}_{speaker_name}_{position}_{timestamp}.m4a

Example: abc123_alice_smith_prop1_20250124153045.m4a
Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	Add microphone permission (REQUIRED)
	‚Ä¢	Run app on real device
	‚Ä¢	Test full debate flow
	‚Ä¢	When backend ready, update API baseURL and set useMockData = false
	‚Ä¢	Add bell sound files (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Deploy to TestFlight or App Store
